    <h1 id="head">Colgate</h1>
    <p id="p1">Colgate is an American Brand that manufactures products related to oral hygiene such as toothpaste, toothbrush, mouthwash, dental floss etc. Colgate is a B2C company that targets its products to all kinds of customers without focusing on one particular group. Colgate follows the red theme color in their products or advertisements of their products so whenever people think of the color red they think about Colgate. </p>
    <p id="p2">The founder of the famous toothpaste company is William Colgate. The company, originally, used to sell soap until the founder's death. After that, from 1873 they started selling toothpaste.  During their early stages, they used to sell toothpaste in glass jars unlike the present where they sell toothpaste in tubes.</p>
    <p id="p3">Everyone tries to publicize and promote their products through various means, just like that some of the Colgate advertisement strategies are listed below:</p>
    <li id="p4">Colgate Bright Smiles, Bright Future Program- They organized a global program called the “Colgate Bright Smiles, Bright Future” where they aimed to provide free dental screening and oral health education to children. This program makes Colgate in to a global act of education, which steps up the level way beyond that of a simple toothpaste brand and this making a lending company in sales of toothpastes.</li>
    <li id="p5">Collaboration with influencers and experts- The company has promoted and showcased their product in various medias like radio, newspapers and TV where they also have popular influencers like Michael Phelps (a professional swimmer), Sloan Stephens (a professional tennis player) and other YouTube personalities. They also take their product to dentists and make them give their honest opinion, which has made the company very trustworthy.</li>
    <li id="p6">The Smile Show- It is a YouTube show which is one the most notable campaigns of Colgate that the company held in which the influencers talk about new Colgate products every new episode. This show got a massive 24 million views. It was targeted to millennials viewers i.e. the people from  GenY. This was worth it, as the show led to 13% increase in brand awareness and 10.8% increase in purchase consideration along with 1116% increase in brand interest.</li>
    <li id="p7">Humorous campaign with photoshop disasters- It was a very clever and funny idea in which they advertised photos for a dental floss. The image had two people smiling and one person with something in their teeth, but the peculiar thing is that in those images, there were abnormalities like having a sixth finger or an extra hand behind the shoulders but the first thing you noticed would be the teeth. This tried to demonstrate that the remaining food draws more attention than any physical defect. This way consumers easily understand the importance of flossing and the company's humor.</li>
